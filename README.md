# BattleBee Demo

### This project is a work in progress


BattleBee is a demo of a video game concept created from scratch from C++, built using the windows.h library.

It uses a renderer built from scratch to draw rectangles onto the screen in pixels, and features smooth acceleration based movement, shooting, and shielding.

This also demonstrates hit detection.
